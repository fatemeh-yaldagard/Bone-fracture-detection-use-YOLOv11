# FractureDetection

An Android project for **hand and leg bone fracture detection** using **YOLOv11 (TFLite)** models.

---

## Features

- **Fracture detection with YOLOv11n and YOLOv11s TFLite models** for fast and accurate detection on mobile and edge devices.
- **Simple user interface** for selecting X-ray images and displaying the detection results in real-time.
- **Cross-device compatibility**: optimized to run efficiently on Android smartphones, tablets, and edge devices with limited resources.
- **Optimized TFLite models** for low-latency inference and minimal memory usage, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Visualization tools**: detected fractures are highlighted directly on the images for clear interpretation and diagnostic support.

## Usage

1. Open the app on an Android device.
2. Select an X-ray image through the app interface.
3. The app processes the image using the YOLOv11 TFLite model.
4. Detected fracture lines are highlighted on the image, with confidence scores displayed if available.
